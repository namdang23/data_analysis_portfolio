# Nam Dang - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Nam! 

I have a finance background and currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degreee in Business Analytics at Drexel University, with a concentration in Functional Area of Business. I have worked for 3+ years in finance and varied from fields such as Risk Management, Financial Service, and Digitalization. Currently my goal is to transition into a more Data-centric position, preferably Data Analyst or Business Analyst. I enjoy learning about data science techniques - especially data models that apply to business operations. I also enjoy data visualization, designing, and creating presentations.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Credit Risk Analytics
**Code:** [`HomeEquity.R`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/00960e672b4b3e297e512ed3aa2f45bca24c8dbe/Project%20code/FinalProject_Group2_HomeEquity.R), [`MortgageLoan.R`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/831b40279df3dd8064fdda46cd7ac84d941f3205/Project%20code/FinalProject_Group2_MortgageLoan.R),
[`MortgageLoan_DeepLearning`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/831b40279df3dd8064fdda46cd7ac84d941f3205/Project%20code/FinalProject_Group2_MortgageLoan_DeepLearning.ipynb),[`HomeEquity_DeepLearning`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/75d15bc3d086f1019f348d502eab84fb0aefc351/Project%20code/FinalProject_Group2_HomeEquity_DeepLearning.ipynb)

**Report:** [`FinalReport_Group2.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/060c499234e69776e9c2a3b6303476c1eaa32088/Presentation/FinalReport_Group2.pdf)   

**Description:** In this project, I had a chance to work with 2 datasets related to Mortgage Loan. The scope of this report is to explore and analyze past data on residential mortgage loans and residential equity loans to get a better understanding of customer creditworthiness. We utilized analytical tools such as Cluster Analysis, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, and Deep Neural Networks. Among all the prediction, models we found that Deep Neural Networks give us the best results for both residential mortgage loan data set and residential equity loan data set  

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, deep learning, classification, data visualization.  


### Forecasting Amazon Revenue/ Net Income
**Code:** [`final_project.R`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/8b2997e403f85d518e36f032743ca04d8f42371b/Project%20code/Final%20Project_Group1.pdf)    

**Report:** [`Final_Project.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/08a4ebdbc05d933667cd81e64e962dadad007740/Presentation/Final_Project_Group_1.pdf)   

**Description:** Amazon has always had a large discrepancy between its revenue and profits (Net Income). This is because Amazon invests a large chunk of their revenue on capital expenses such as Data centers, warehouses, upgrading distribution centers. To be able to forecast with reasonable accuracy the revenue and net income for the upcoming quarter would enable amazon to plan in a better way their expenses and help them make better business decisions. We have used 2 different iterations of 2 forecasting methods (ETS and ARIMA) to make the forecasts for Revenue forecasting as well as Net Income forecasting.    

**Skills:** time series forcasting, ETS, ARIMA, fpp3 package.    

### Employee Retention Analysis
**Code:** [`Final_Project_STAT642.R`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/05c535d6ece15d19e486977acc986710a6161dc8/Project%20code/STAT642%20-%20Final%20Project%20-%20Group%207.R)

**Report:** [`slides.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/f6c738ea36f396331ef616b4c8d8ef37f20619f5/Presentation/STAT642-%20Group7%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf)    

**Description:** This project aims to elaborate the problem of employee attrition, present the findings of research conducted on factors influencing it, and offer potential solutions to curb attrition. It also provides a deeper insight into the process we followed while conducting the analyses. We did this using supervised & unsupervised methods of building prediction models in R   

**Skills:** classification models, decision tree, support vector machine, cluster analysis.      

### Loan Predication
**Code:** [`Final_Presentation_code.ipynb `](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/9ecd106a361a08dd03c23ec6d86fbe69775b5994/Project%20code/Group%202%20_%20Final%20Presentation%20_Code.ipynb)    
**Report:** [`Final_Presentation_slide.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/9ecd106a361a08dd03c23ec6d86fbe69775b5994/Presentation/Loan%20Predication%20Final.pdf)  

**Description:** An assurance company is having a critical issue with loan approval process as the current process requires a lot of time and labor resources. The company seeks to automate (in real time) the loan qualifying procedure based on information given by borrowers. A machine learning model can help accelerate decision-making process with higher accuracy in approving a loan for a new borrower.

**Skills:** logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-NN.     

### Causes of Accident in California 
**Dashboard canvas:** [`accident.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/05409262b18536c9a02b7235376ef9df333e01ef/Presentation/Accident%20final_Gp3.pdf)   
**Description:** A Tableau presentation on visualizing road accident and causes in California.    
**Skills:** Data processing, visualization, story-telling.    
**Technology:** Tableau.    

### A/B Testing for CCG Advertisement

**Presentation:** [`MKTG-607 Final Presentation.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/27fd966701b36f1829e9891dab89a55a075c000c/Presentation/MKTG-607%20Final%20Presentation.pdf) 

**Report:** [`MKTG 607 - Group 3 - Project Report.pdf`](https://github.com/namdang23/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/27fd966701b36f1829e9891dab89a55a075c000c/Presentation/MKTG%20607%20-%20Group%203%20-%20Project%20Report.pdf)

**Description:** In this project, we conducted a simple A/B testing on the event advertisement emails for CCG. We sent out 2 emails: one uses formal and professional language, and the other contains a more student-like, laid back content. We wanted to know if student's sign-up rate and attendance rate differ between the two email group. Therefore, we used A/B testing, complementary with Bayesian Analysis to intepret our result.   

**Skills:** R, A/B Testing, Bayesian Analysis, Marketing.
