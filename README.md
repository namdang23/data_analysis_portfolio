# Nam Dang - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Nam! 

I have a finance background and currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) degreee in Business Analytics at Drexel University, with a concentration in Functional Area of Business. I have worked for 4 years in finance and varied from fields such as Risk Management, Financial Service, and Digital Marketing. Currently my goal is to transition into a more Data-centric position, preferably Data Analyst or Business Analyst. I enjoy learning about data science techniques - especially data models that apply to business operations. I also enjoy data visualization, designing, and creating presentations.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
